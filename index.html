  <p><div>Today we say goodbye to two great and long time staff members of /g/tracker and other InstallGentoo services. <a href="http://gtracker.installgentoo.com/user.php?id=13">dellfag</a> and <a href="http://gtracker.installgentoo.com/user.php?id=10">pictron</a> have been with installgentoo since the early days of the tracker and have helped to build this community in to what it is today. Hanging the Staff Jacket up on the rack, they will be the first to take the Legend jacket off the wall and start wearing it with pride. Please stop in to this thread to wish them both well.</div></p>

  <p>Our status blog has been moved an reworked countless times, and this is just another one of those times.</p>


<p>I have moved it to, yes, loltumblr.  For a few reasons&#8230;</p>


<p>First being I strongly feel that blogger is gonna get the axe one of these days, its stale, its stagnant, and just all around shit.  I can easily see google pulling the plug.</p>


<p>Next tumblr and newer blogging platforms have better integration with social media and other things. As well as just being all around newer, fresher and better feeling.</p>


<p>Some of you may be asking, like many others have, why I am not hosting my own blog.  Well if something happens, to say, all of the servers how would I let you know?</p>


<p>So for now we are on tumblr, I am silently contemplating moving to wordpress.com but tumblr is good enough for now.</p>

  <p>It came to my attention that sometime last night users were having trouble connecting to the FTP server. After looking into this vsftpd seems to be having issues, and specifically issues with the version packaged for debian wheezy.<br/><br/>To resolve this I have moved us over a different daemon, until vsftpd can get fixed.</p>

  <p>Okay since I have been asking several times about what is going on, I have decided to post a statement about our FTP service.<br/><br/>First a little back story&#8230;<br/><br/>There was a new #/g/tracker user/member who showed up around a month ago.  This user/member was a very odd user who often brought up arguments on strange topics.  <br/><br/>This member while a nuisance was tolerated as we are not an elitist group that silences people that annoy us.<br/><br/>Until this member, dropped dox on another member and attempted to on two other staff members.  This is not tolerated in our humble community and he was banned.  His /g/mail was also disabled in the process.<br/><br/>This made the now bannished member upset and he decided to report our FTP service to our hosting provider and to some copyright watchdog groups.  Thus unleashing a huge shit storm upon /g/ and installgentoo.com community.<br/><br/>So the staff and myself went into containment mode, our primary irc channel was on lock down, the ftp was turned off and our main site was changed.  <br/><br/>That is entire story, anything else was pure speculation or lie.<br/><br/><br/>Today the staff has made some decisions on how things will be changed from now on.<br/><br/></p>


<ul><li>First ftp access will be brought back shortly though with a new password, this password will rotate monthly and be posted in #/g/ftp on our irc.</li><li>We also plan on changing which web irc clients will be permitted to access our irc server, soon it will be just our own ran webirc client, sorry.</li><li>Our main site will return shortly, probably with some new design. </li><li>Some new more clear cut rules, apparently some do not know doxxing without permission is bad.</li></ul>


<br/><br/><br/>For now that is all, please if you have any questions you should now how to contact me.<br/><br/>Also if you really desire to see a real shit thread you can view that <a href="http://rbt.asia/g/thread/36825476">here</a>, most of that thread is speculation and lies.  But hey you&#8217;re gonna believe what you&#8217;re gonna believe. <br/><br/>I am sorry for the downtime of our loyal users.

  <p>Our beloved FTP service will be down until a decision can be made on the course it will take.  Please know all the data is safe and will return.<br/><br/>We are just waiting for a &#8220;shitstorm&#8221; to blow over.  Our main page will return soon as well.   All is okay.</p>

  <p>Today I have successfully setup and added our own mailing lists server.  It is at <a href="http://lists.installgentoo.com/"><a href="http://lists.installgentoo.com">http://lists.installgentoo.com</a></a>.  Please sign up for our announcements list to stay up to date on news for installgentoo.com.  I have also added the mailing list lel, for general fun and just playing with mailing lists.<br/><br/>If anyone can think of other lists, or would like a list for their own project please let me know.<br/><br/>Also I need to mention that I have updated our beloved gtrackerbot, now gtrackerbot3.  It is a tweaked jenni/phenny bot that eventually I will repost the source for.  We are also currently tweaking and playing with a gazelle irc bot so that it can directly interface with our tracker.</p>

  <p>I have heard from many of our /g/tracker users that when the upload a torrent it does not show up on the site.  Then a few hours later it does.<br/><br/>The issue that is happening is our memcache of the site is a bit slow.  I will be looking at tweaking soon to fix the delay in torrents appearing so please bear with.</p>
